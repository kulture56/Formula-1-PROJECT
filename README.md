**Formula 1 Analysis**
Welcome to my **F1** analysis. From the year 2021 to 2023.
We get to see the driver's perfomance on different tracks in different cars and also on different weather conditions around the world. 
For 2024 I try to predict both the individual championship winner and constructors winners for the 2024 season. 
The tables and graphs show visualizations of different analysis which helps to improve my data story-telling.

**Enjoy!!!**
